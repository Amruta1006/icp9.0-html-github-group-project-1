    <h1>The 6 most spectacular places to visit in India</h1><header>
    <p>India’s astonishing variety of sights has to be seen to be believed. Travelers have devoted lifetimes 
        to exploring the famous places and forgotten corners of this incredible country, driven onwards by 
        the certainty that there’s always more to see. </p>

        <p>Well, our advice is to not take on too much during a single visit. Pick an area 
            – the tropical south perhaps, or the northern plains, or the mountain valleys of the Himalayas – 
            and give yourself time to pause and soak up the atmosphere as you work through your <b><u>must-see list.</u></b>

        <p>Best for romantics and fans of Mughal history</p>

        <p>At the top of everyone’s bucket list, the <u>Taj Mahal</u> is as glorious as people imagine 
           it would be – a magnificent monument to lost love, executed in pearl-white marble. 
            Views of the world’s most beautiful building framed by a Mughal archway or floating 
            above the misty Yamuna River will be one of the defining moments of any trip to India.</p> 
         <p>But there’s more to the former Mughal capital than the Taj. Add on a couple of days so you 
            can visit the architecturally stunning tomb of Emperor Akbar, his rose-red sandstone former 
            capital at Fatehpur Sikri and sprawling Agra Fort, one of India’s most epic fortifications. 
            Thronged by millions of visitors, Agra is not always relaxing, but it’s eternally fascinating.</p>

                <p>There are few places as beguiling and bewitching as the sacred Hindu city of <u>Varanasi</u>.
                     Millennia-old death rituals play out daily at the cremation ghats that line the bank of 
                     the sacred River Ganges, while the maze-like alleyways of the nearby old town reveal dizzying 
                     surprises at every turn. We defy anyone to visit without experiencing some internal soul-searching 
                     about their place in the universe.</p>

                <p>Mumbai is the perfect place to take the pulse of modern India. 
                    The most densely populated city in the subcontinent is home to <u>Bollywood film stars</u>, 
                    enterprising market vendors, bankers and executives rushing to work in offices, and fishing 
                    families who can trace their origins back to the days when this mighty metropolis was just a humble village.</p>

                <p>In the far northwest of India, sheltered from the monsoon by the rain shadow of the Himalayas, 
                    the former <u>Buddhist kingdom of Ladakh</u> is culturally and geographically closer to western Tibet
                     than anywhere in India. In this high-altitude moonscape, towering Tibetan monasteries melt into a 
                     landscape of barren rock and wind-sculpted hoodoos (don’t miss fabulous Hemis and Thiksey on the 
                     road linking Ladakh to Himachal Pradesh).</p>

                <p>The capital of colonial British India until 1911, <u>Kolkata</u> (formerly Calcutta) 
                    is India’s third-biggest metropolis and the country's intellectual and artistic capital. 
                    Spend a few days exploring the energetic bazaars, cultured museums and British-era landmarks, 
                    and you’ll soon fall in love with Kolkata’s irrepressible energy.

                <p>The desert state of Rajasthan shows India at its <u>most romantic and soft-filtered</u>. 
                    Expect a mirage of camel caravans, ornate palaces, mighty forts, turbaned traders and 
                    intense colors, set against a backdrop of shifting desert sands. It’s unbelievably photogenic,
                     but also firmly on the tourist map, so expect to share the experience with a crowd.</p>

                <p>Best for budding Buddhists</p>
                <p>As the birthplace of Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism and Sikhism (plus countless smaller faiths),
                     India is defined by sacred geography. Even here, however, few places resonate <u>more powerfully </u>than 
                     the Bodhi tree where Prince Siddhartha Gautama achieved enlightenment to become the Buddha (Awakened One).</p>

                <p>India has pilgrimage destinations to spare, but few come close to the vibrant energy of the <u>Golden Temple in Amritsar.</u>
                     The most sacred site for the Sikh religion is a gleaming jewel box, floating in a mirror-like sacred pool, thronged 
                     day and night by an unbelievable mass of pilgrims. You don’t have to be spiritually inclined to feel its powerful rhythms. </p>
