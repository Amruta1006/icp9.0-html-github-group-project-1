    <p>Hiking is a long, vigorous walk, usually on trails or footpaths in the countryside. Walking for pleasure developed in Europe during the eighteenth century.Religious pilgrimages have existed much longer but they involve walking long distances for a spiritual purpose associated with specific religions.Hiking sometimes involves bushwhacking and is sometimes referred to as such. This specifically refers to difficult walking through dense forest, undergrowth, or bushes where forward progress requires pushing vegetation aside. In extreme cases of bushwhacking, where the vegetation is so dense that human passage is impeded, a machete is used to clear a pathway. The Australian term bushwalking refers to both on and off-trail hiking.Common terms for hiking used by New Zealanders are tramping (particularly for overnight and longer trips),walking or bushwalking. Trekking is the preferred word used to describe multi-day hiking in the mountainous regions of India, Pakistan, Nepal, North America, South America, Iran, and the highlands of East Africa.</p>

    <p>The trail originates from the Donje Gaon Phata bus stop.</p>

       <p> The trek itself can be divided into two sections- the first stretch is a tar road from Donje Gaon that gently climbs up to the parking spot for two-wheelers. It can also be covered on a bike. The second half of the trek is a steep but incredibly rewarding climb to the top of the fort.</p>

        <p>Indian culture is the heritage of social norms and technologies that originated in or are associated with the ethno-linguistically diverse India, pertaining to the Indian subcontinent until 1947 and the Republic of India post-1947. The term also applies beyond India to countries and cultures whose histories are strongly connected to India by immigration, colonisation, or influence, particularly in South Asia and Southeast Asia. India's languages, religions, dance, music, architecture, food, and customs differ from place to place within the country.</p>

        <h3><u>1.Celebrate the festival of colours</u></h3>
        <img src="../Images/holi.jpg" height="250px">
        <p>Celebrated during the month of Phalguna which usually falls in March in the Gregorian calendar, Holi is a joyful ancient Hindu festival. Known as the festival of colour and love, Holi is celebrated to mark the onset of spring. It also commemorates the victory of good over evil and is a time to play, laugh and forgive. The festival is regarded as a major cultural event, celebrated by both natives and foreigners. But beware, along with bags of colour, even water guns come out to play!</p>

        <h3><u>2. Join a heritage tour in Varanasi</u></h3>
        <img src="../Images/varanasi-india-culture-tour-840x557.jpg" height="250px">
        <p>Varanasi is a fascinating place and the best way to experience it is by wandering through its ancient alleyways and streets. Numerous walking tours are conducted daily to bring the city’s stories alive.

            The learning and Burning Tour is the most popular among travellers. Traversing the ashrams, the humble abode of sadhus (holy men), followed by a journey to the sacred cremation grounds, temples, and ponds. One of the most celebrated beliefs surrounding this sacred city is that dying and being cremated along the banks of the river Ganges allows your soul to break the cycle of rebirth, leading to salvation. There’s no where quite like Varanasi.</p>

            <h3><u>3.Attend a yoga class</u></h3>
            <img src="../Images/yoga-cultural-experiences-in-india.jpg" height="270px">
            <p>Long before yoga class became popular in the West, it was developed in India over 5000 years ago. My friend who I was travelling with had already been to North India the year before so she could obtain the certificates needed to become a yoga teacher. By comparison, I’ve only been to a couple of classes in the UK so I was a little intimidated at the prospect of attending a class with her in Pondicherry when she suggested it. As it turned out, I needn’t have worried because the teacher placed an emphasis on breathing and meditation. I did come away from the class feeling a bit more limber but most of all, more relaxed.</p>

            <h3><u>4.Witness the spectacle of Ganga Aarati in Haridwar</u></h3>
            <img src="../Images/india-cultural-experience-festivals-ceremonies-1536x1207.jpeg" height="250px">
            <p>The Ganga Aarti is a mesmerising spectacle that beckons travellers and devotees from across the globe to Haridwar, one of India’s holiest cities. This age-old ritual, held on the sacred banks of the River Ganges, is a symphony of fire, water, and devotion that leaves a lasting impression on all who witness it.The city is believed to be a gateway to the divine and a place where the sacred Ganges River flows through. The Ganga Aarti, performed daily at Har Ki Pauri ghat, is the city’s spiritual heart, and it embodies the essence of devotion, faith, and the eternal bond between humans and the sacred river.</p>
